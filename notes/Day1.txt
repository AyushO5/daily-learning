Execution Context in JavaScript** is the environment where JavaScript code is evaluated and executed.
Whenever JS runs code, it creates an execution context.
There are three main types: **Global Execution Context**, **Function Execution Context**, and **Eval Execution Context**.
Each execution context has two phases: **Creation phase** and **Execution phase**.
In the creation phase, memory is allocated for variables and functions (hoisting happens here).
In the execution phase, code runs line by line and variables get actual values.
The global execution context is created first and only once.
Function execution contexts are created whenever a function is called and are managed using the **call stack**.
